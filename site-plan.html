          I am an American living in Poland, passionate about teaching English as a second language. I have had 6+ years of in-person group lessons and individual online lessons. I engage students using humor and activities designed to improve speech and motivate correct grammar usage with an emphasis on multi-cultural awareness. I create a trusting atmosphere with sensitivity to students' strengths, weaknesses, and personal learning styles. I can speak and write Polish at the B2/Intermediate level. <!-- change this -->
